# ReactSiteTemplate

Now known as Penguin Tours, Ltd., this website was built originally with our React site template.

In order to maximize SEO and social media interaction, the site was adapted to server side rendering
with Next.js.

The site continues to represent our core build for websites, including a landing page and six pages of content including Home, Services, Portfolio, Testimonials, Faq, and Contact.

The site also features a video lightbox on the home page and an image lightbox option on the portfolio page.

All our sites offer a contact page which forwards an email to the site owner with the help of an external API.

Styling for this website was enabled by using customized Bootstrap with Sass.
